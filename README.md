# Vscode-Gitbook

Because there are some bugs in the Mac version of Gitbook Editor,it is not convenient to use them. When a single page length needs to be slid, each deletion is unusually stuck, slow, and disturbing. Vscode-Gitbook adds related feature support for Vscode.

Since there are some bugs in Gitbook Editor (Mac version), I made this extension so I could use vscode as the Gitbook Editor!

## Features

* If there are SUMMARY.md files, auto-activate the plug-in
* document tree support editing function, You can add, delete, and rename nodes
* The change of the document excuse tree is automatically synchronized to the SUMMARY.md file
* SUMMARY.md file changes are made, the left document tree synchronizes the updated

* Extension will be actived when SUMMARY.md exits.
* You can edit book structure in the Gitbook Struct Explorer View. (Create node, rename node or delete node)
* All changes made in the structure view will be synchronized to SUMMARY.md
* Gitbook struct will be updated once SUMMARY.md changed.
